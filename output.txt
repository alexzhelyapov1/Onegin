All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,

According to the phrase or the addition
Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,

Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
All given to mine ear.
All. No, let's come in!
Ambassador. The sight is dismal;
An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
Adieu, adieu, adieu! Remember me. Exit.
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
Affront Ophelia.
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
After the thing it loves.
Against the which a moiety competent
Against thy mother aught. Leave her to heaven,
Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
All in the morning bedtime,
All may be well. He kneels.
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past

All. Treason! treason!
An thou hadst not come to my bed.'
Among a mineral of metals base,
And I with them the third night kept the watch;
And I'll be plac'd so please you, in the ear
And a man's life is no more than to say 'one.'
And I a maid at your window,
And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
All. Our duty to your honour.
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,
An understanding simple and unschool'd;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
And (would it were not so!) you are my mother.

And I beseech you instantly to visit
And I am sick at heart.
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
And after we will both our judgments join
And all we mourn for.
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes

All flaxen was his poll.
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
All my smooth body.
And I the matter will reword; which madness
And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep-
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
And break your own neck down.
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
And do not spread the compost on the weeds
And do't the speedier that you may direct me
And either [master] the devil, or throw him out
And even the like precurse of fierce events,
And can say nothing! No, not for a king,
And call it accident.
And call the noblest to the audience.
And carriage of the article design'd,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
And draw you into madness? Think of it.
And drive his purpose on to these delights.
And each particular hair to stand an end
And for his death no wind
And could of men distinguish, her election
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
And dupp'd the chamber door,
And end his being. That done, he lets me go,
And enterprises of great pith and moment
And ever three parts coward,- I do not know
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
And do such bitter business as the day
And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
And for my means, I'll husband them so well
And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
And for the day confin'd to fast in fires,
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
And our vain blows malicious mockery.
And passion in the gods.'
And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
And that our drift look through our bad performance.
And to the manner born, it is a custom
And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,
And for your rapier most especially,
And hath abatements and delays as many
And nothing is at a like goodness still;
And set a double varnish on the fame
And that I see, in passages of proof,
And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
And wager on your heads. He, being remiss,
And with a larger tether may he walk
And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
And foreign mart for implements of war;
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.
And gave you such a masterly report
And gem of all the nation.
And hears it roar beneath.
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
And his commission to employ those soldiers,
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him.
And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties
And gins to pale his uneffectual fire.
And hath shipped me intil the land,
And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
And in his grave rain'd many a tear.
And he to England shall along with you.
And he, repulsed, a short tale to make,
And his sandal shoon.
And hit the woundless air.- O, come away!
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend,
And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
And if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
And in part him.' Do you mark this, Reynaldo?
And hurt my brother.
And in the cup an union shall he throw
And let us once again assail your ears,
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
And keep you in the rear of your affection,
And in the porches of my ears did pour
And leads the will to desperate undertakings
And let all sleep, while to my shame I see
And in this brainish apprehension kills
And it must follow, as the night the day,
And let him know so.
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
And live the purer with the other half,
And makes each petty artire in this body
And meant to wrack thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
And many such-like as's of great charge,
And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shame
And lay your hands again upon my sword.
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
And let them know both what we mean to do
And lose the name of action.- Soft you now!
And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
And makes as healthful music. It is not madness
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
And more above, hath his solicitings,
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
And never come mischance between us twain!
And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi', you.
And my imaginations are as foul
And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
And not have strew'd thy grave.
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
And not where I had aim'd them.
And thy commandment all alone shall live
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
And our affairs from England come too late.
And pious action we do sugar o'er
And pity 'tis 'tis true. A foolish figure!
And prais'd be rashness for it; let us know,
And prey on garbage.
And prologue to the omen coming on,
And put it in his pocket!
And reason panders will.
And recks not his own rede.
And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
And shall I couple hell? Hold, hold, my heart!
And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
And so, without more circumstance at all,
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
And that in way of caution- I must tell you
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine-
And there I see such black and grained spots
And there assume some other, horrible form
And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
And tell you what I know.
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
And thus a while the fit will work on him.
And there did seem in him a kind of joy
And therefore I forbid my tears; but yet
And these few precepts in thy memory
And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
And thus the native hue of resolution
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
And we shall jointly labour with your soul
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
And we cast away moan.
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon
And what's untimely done. [So haply slander-]
And where th' offence is let the great axe fall.
And will he not come again?
And will he not come again?
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.
And they can well on horseback; but this gallant
And they in France of the best rank and station
And thirty dozed moons with borrowed sheen
And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
And we did think it writ down in our duty
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
And what's in prayer but this twofold force,
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse
And vanish'd from our sight.
And when you are desirous to be blest,
And with a look so piteous in purport
And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
And sure I am two men there are not living
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
And sets a blister there; makes marriage vows
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven,
And since so neighbour'd to his youth and haviour,
And so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd.
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
And that your Grace hath screen'd and stood between
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
And thou must cure me. Till I know 'tis done,
And the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
And where 'tis so, th' offender's scourge is weigh'd,
And to the last bended their light on me.
And we beseech you, bend you to remain
And will not let belief take hold of him
And will not wrong it.
And will this brother's wager frankly play.
And with his head over his shoulder turn'd
And with no less nobility of love
And with such coz'nage- is't not perfect conscience
And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
And with th' encorporal air do hold discourse?
And you are stay'd for. There- my blessing with thee!
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
And you the judges, bear a wary eye.
And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,-
And, as I think, they have already order
And, as the sleeping soldiers in th' alarm,
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
And, like a man to double business bound,
Appears before them and with solemn march
Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
Are joyfully return'd.
Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
And, sister, as the winds give benefit
Are most select and generous, chief in that.
And, like the kind life-rend'ring pelican,
And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
Answer, and think upon this business.
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
Aroused vengeance sets him new awork;
Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay.
As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' th' working,
Anon, as patient as the female dove
And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
And, as the world were now but to begin,
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this, ha?
As level as the cannon to his blank,
Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which when it falls,
As England was his faithful tributary,
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
As I do thee. Something too much of this I
As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
As false as dicers' oaths. O, such a deed
As will not leave their tinct.
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
As are companions noted and most known
As checking at his voyage, and that he means
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
As day does to your eye.
As from the body of contraction plucks
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
Been thus encount'red. A figure like your father,
As did that one; and that, in my regard,
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
As if increase of appetite had grown
Away! for everything is seal'd and done
Both [Mar. and Ber.] We do, my lord.
Both. Arm'd, my lord.
Both. My lord, from head to foot.
But I will delve one yard below their mines
But even then the morning cock crew loud,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
But answer made it none. Yet once methought
But break my heart, for I must hold my tongue!
But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
But look, amazement on thy mother sits.
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
But two months dead! Nay, not so much, not two.
But we will ship him hence; and this vile deed
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
By letters congruing to that effect,
By what it fed on; and yet, within a month-
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
As fits a king's remembrance.
As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
As harbingers preceding still the fates
As he is very potent with such spirits,
As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so.
As hush as death- anon the dreadful thunder
As if I had never been such.
As if he had been loosed out of hell
As in their birth,- wherein they are not guilty,
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
As it doth well appear unto our state,
As love between them like the palm might flourish,
As if it some impartment did desire
As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
As it hath us'd to do- that I have found
As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
As infinite as man may undergo-
As he in his particular act and place
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.
As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost,
As meditation or the thoughts of love,
As it is common for the younger sort
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
As may dishonour him- take heed of that;
As low as to the fiends!
As make your bouts more violent to that end-
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
As of a father; for let the world take note
As oft as any passion under heaven
As to expend your time with us awhile
As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
Attendants with foils and gauntlets.
Be you and I behind an arras then.
As one incapable of her own distress,
As one, in suff'ring all, that suffers nothing;
As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
As therein are set down.
As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
As to peace-parted souls.
At last, a little shaking of mine arm,
Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
Attendants].
Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark. [Writes.]
Be all my sins rememb'red.
Be but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come.
Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
At his head a grass-green turf,
At his heels a stone.
As we have warranty. Her death was doubtful;
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
Attends the boist'rous ruin. Never alone
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
Before mine uncle. I'll observe his looks;
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear.
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Be something scanter of your maiden presence.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
Before You visit him, to make inquire
Be you content to lend your patience to us,
Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
Been struck so to the soul that presently
Before my daughter told me), what might you,
Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
Being a thing immortal as itself?
Behind the arras I'll convey myself
Ber. 'Tis here!
Believe so much in him, that he is young,
Ber. Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.
Ber. 'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
Ber. Have you had quiet guard?
Ber. He.
Ber. How now, Horatio? You tremble and look pale.
Ber. Long live the King!
Ber. I have seen nothing.
Ber. I think it be no other but e'en so.
Ber. In the same figure, like the King that's dead.
Ber. It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
Ber. It would be spoke to.
Ber. Last night of all,
Ber. Say-
Both. Longer, longer.
Break we our watch up; and by my advice
Ber. See, it stalks away!
Ber. Sit down awhile,
Ber. Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.
Ber. Well, good night.
Bernardo, officer.
Ber. Who's there.?
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Between the pass and fell incensed points
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
Both. We will haste us.
Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
But I do prophesy th' election lights
Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
But I have that within which passeth show-
But age with his stealing steps
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
But do not go with it!
But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
But fill unshaken when they mellow be.
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
But how does it well? It does well to those that do ill. Now,
But if the gods themselves did see her then,
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
But in battalions! First, her father slain;
But mere implorators of unholy suits,
But let me hear from you.
But look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
But let this same be presently perform'd,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-
But on! Six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
But woe is me! you are so sick of late,
But soft! behold! Lo, where it comes again!
But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King-
But sure the bravery of his grief did put me
But that I know love is begun by time,
Come short of what he did.
But soft! methinks I scent the morning air.
But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother
Can you advise me?
Clown. A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'A pour'd a flagon of
Clown. A whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?
Clown. E'en that.
Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day?
But that this folly douts it. Exit.
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
But this eternal blazon must not be
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
But to confront the visage of offence?
But to my mind, though I am native here
But to recover of us, by strong hand
But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
But what we do determine oft we break.
But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
But you must know, your father lost a father;

Come, some music!
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.
Comes armed through our watch, so like the King
Couch we awhile, and mark.
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Conjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand
Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood
Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
Contagious blastments are most imminent.
Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet
Cornelius, courtier.
Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
Do not as some ungracious pastors do,
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.
Could force his soul so to his own conceit
Could not (with all their quantity of love)
Could not so mope.
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night.
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
Deliberate pause. Diseases desperate grown
Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
Dies in his own too-much. That we would do,
Dies not alone, but like a gulf doth draw
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
Directly seasons him his enemy.

Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell
Look to't, I charge you. Come your ways.
King. How fares our cousin Hamlet?
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine.
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations;
Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
Mar. Let's follow. 'Tis not fit thus to obey him.
Mar. Look with what courteous action
Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
Mar. Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
Mar. You shall not go, my lord.
More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
Mar. No, it is struck.
May be a devil; and the devil hath power
May sweep to my revenge.
More relative than this. The play's the thing

Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me
Both to my God and to my gracious king;

Both. Ay, by heaven, my lord.
Both. My lord, we will not.
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?
But better look'd into, he truly found
But if't be he I mean, he's very wild
Both. We'll wait upon you.
But come!
But farewell it, for I will use no art.
But from what cause he will by no means speak.
But you'll be secret?
But he's an arrant knave.
But if you hold it fit, after the play
But keep a farm and carters.
But let that go.
But you shall hear. Thus:
But never doubt I love.
Doubt that the sun doth move;
But that the dread of something after death-
But truly I do fear it.
But with a crafty madness keeps aloof
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
By heaven, it is as proper to our age
By indirections find directions out.
By the mass, I was about to say something! Where did I leave?
By this encompassment and drift of question
Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
Come hither, gentlemen,
Come on! You hear this fellow in the cellarage.
Come.

Consent to swear.

Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
Perpend.
Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
Oph. Nay 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Oph. No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
Oph. No, my lord.
Oph. O my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
Oph. What is, my lord?
Oph. So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens
Or then, or then, with such or such; and, as you say,
Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
Pol. And let him ply his music.
Oph. You are merry, my lord.
Or (not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
Player. I warrant your honour.
Pleasant and helpful to him!
Play something like the murther of my father
Player. I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
Pol. 'And in part him, but,' you may say, 'not well.
Pol. 'Tis most true;
Pol. And then, sir, does 'a this- 'a does- What was I about to say?
Pol. At 'closes in the consequence'- Ay, marry!
Pol. Affection? Pooh! You speak like a green girl,
Pol. And the Queen too, and that presently.
Pol. At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him.
Pol. Away, I do beseech you, both away
Pol. Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to, go to!
Pol. Ay, springes to catch woodcocks! I do know,
Pol. If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
Pol. Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
Pol. Hath there been such a time- I would fain know that-
Pol. Marry, I will teach you! Think yourself a baby
Pol. Faith, no, as you may season it in the charge.
Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I believe
Pol. What treasure had he, my lord?
Pol. You know sometimes he walks four hours together
Pol. Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.
Pol. Come, sirs.
Pol. Give first admittance to th' ambassadors.
Pol. Good madam, stay awhile. I will be faithful. [Reads.]
Pol. Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
Pol. Mad for thy love?
Pol. Do you know me, my lord?
Pol. Farewell!
Pol. God b' wi' ye, fare ye well!
Pol. I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' th' Capitol; Brutus
Pol. Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
Pol. I have, my lord.
Pol. I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
Pol. Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
Pol. Look, whe'r he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
Pol. Marry, sir, here's my drift,
Pol. Marry, well bethought!
Pol. Marry, well said, very well said. Look you, sir,
Pol. My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
Pol. Honest, my lord?
Pol. Observe his inclination in yourself.
Pol. Not I, my lord.
Pol. That hath made him mad.
Pol. Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
Pol. That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
Pol. That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
Pol. That's very true, my lord.
Pol. The time invites you. Go, your servants tend.
Pol. What do you think of me?
Pol. This is too long.
Pol. This business is well ended.
Pol. What follows then, my lord?
Pol. What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
Pol. What said he?
Pol. Wherefore should you do this?
Pol. With what, i' th' name of God I
Pol. You shall do marvell's wisely, good Reynaldo,
How does your honour for this many a day?
I never gave you aught.
How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
If't be th' affliction of his love, or no,
I have sworn't.
I pray you, now receive them.
It is 'Adieu, adieu! Remember me.'
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?
Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
King. Love? his affections do not that way tend;
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
King. [aside] O, 'tis too true!
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
Must give us pause. There's the respect
My tables! Meet it is I set it down
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Oph. At home, my lord.
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
No traveller returns- puzzles the will,
O most pernicious woman!
O heavy burthen!
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
On Fortune's cap we are not the very button.
Oph. Good my lord,
Oph. I was the more deceived.
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues
Oph. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
Oph. Madam, I wish it may.
Oph. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
Oph. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did,
Oph. My lord, I have remembrances of yours
Oph. My lord?
Oph. O heavenly powers, restore him!
Pol. Indeed, that is out o' th' air. [Aside] How pregnant sometimes
Oph. O, help him, you sweet heavens!
Oph. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
Oph. What means your lordship?
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
Pol. Fare you well, my lord.
Pol. I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
Pol. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.
Pol. You go to seek the Lord Hamlet. There he is.
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Rankly abus'd. But know, thou noble youth,
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;
Repugnant to command. Unequal match'd,
Resembles that it was. What it should be,
Rey. As gaming, my lord.
Rey. Ay, very well, my lord.
Ros. [to Polonius] God save you, sir!
Pol. My lord, I have news to tell you.
Pol. The actors are come hither, my lord.
Pol. Upon my honour-
Pol. The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
Pol. [aside] Still on my daughter.
Pol. What is the matter, my lord?
Pol. [points to his head and shoulder] Take this from this, if this
Put your dread pleasures more into command
Queen. Ay, amen!
Pol. [aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter. Yet
Queen. But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
Queen. Came this from Hamlet to her?
Pol. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you,
Pol. Well be with you, gentlemen!
Pol. [aside] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.-
Pol. [to the King] O, ho! do you mark that?
Queen. Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
Rey. I will, my lord.
Rey. My lord, I did intend it.
Rey. My lord, that would dishonour him.
Ros. Ay, that they do, my lord- Hercules and his load too.
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
Ros. Ay, my lord. They stay upon your patience.
Ros. My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Queen. Did he receive you well?
Queen. Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
Queen. More matter, with less art.
Queen. Did you assay him
Queen. I doubt it is no other but the main,
Receives rebuke from Norway, and, in fine,
Queen. I shall obey you;
Queen. it may be, very like.
Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon,
Receiv'd his love?
Queen. Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.
Rey. At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
Rey. But, my good lord-
Rey. Good my lord! [Going.]
Ros. Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
Rey. My lord, I have.
Rey. Well, my lord.
Rome-
Rey. Very good, my lord.
Ros. Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the
Ros. My most dear lord!
Ros. Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is,
Ros. Neither, my lord.
Ros. Then is the world one.
Ros. No indeed are they not.
Ros. None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
Ros. To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
Ros. As the indifferent children of the earth.
Queen. So he does indeed.
Rey. Ay, my lord,
Rey. I shall, my lord.
Ros. I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
Running it thus) you'll tender me a fool.
Ros. To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
Ros. To what end, my lord?
Ros. Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
Ros. We think not so, my lord.
Ros. Why, then your ambition makes it one. 'Tis too narrow for your
Ros. [aside to Guildenstern] What say you?
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
Scene II.
Sith nor th' exterior nor the inward man
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
So much from th' understanding of himself,
So to seduce!- won to his shameful lust
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word:
Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state,
Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down!
Scene II.
Ros. Both your Majesties
Ros. Good my lord!
Ros. Madam, it so fell out that certain players
Ros. Most like a gentleman.
Ros. Niggard of question, but of our demands
Ros. We shall, my lord.
Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?
Scene IV.
See you now-
Shall in the general censure take corruption
Shall you my son. You have me, have you not
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
Ros. Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
Ros. He does confess he feels himself distracted,
Say, why is this? wherefore? What should we do?
Since nature cannot choose his origin,-
Set your entreatments at a higher rate
So horridly to shake our disposition
So oft it chances in particular men
Scene V.
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
So levied as before, against the Polack;
So, by my former lecture and advice,
So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
Sprung from neglected love.- How now, Ophelia?
Such as it is; and for my own poor part,
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
Termagant. It out-herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
Than may be given you. In few, Ophelia,
That I have Positively said ''Tis so,'
That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling
That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
So much as from occasion you may glean,
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
Swear by my sword.
T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Than is my deed to my most painted word.
Than your particular demands will touch it.
That I have longed long to re-deliver.
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
That I, the son of a dear father murther'd,
That ever I was born to set it right!
That he is open to incontinency.
That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
That, being of so young clays brought up with him,
So, proceed you.
Some little time; so by your companies
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
Sound a flourish. [Enter Trumpets and Kettledrums. Danish
Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,
T' assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo! his sword,
Th' unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
Swear by my sword.
Than to entreaty.
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
That it might please you to give quiet pass
That it went hand in hand even with the vow
That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits
That you know aught of me- this is not to do,
That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
That looks so many fadoms to the sea
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
That makes calamity of so long life.
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
That so his sickness, age, and impotence
That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
That swift as quicksilverr it courses through
That we find out the cause of this effect-
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
The head and source of all your son's distemper.
The form of plausive manners, that these men
The instant burst of clamour that she made
The serpent that did sting thy father's life
The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
The leperous distilment; whose effect
The natural gates and alleys of the body,
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.
The need we have to use you did provoke
The pith and marrow of our attribute.
The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;
The time is out of joint. O cursed spite
The very place puts toys of desperation,
Their virtues else- be they as pure as grace,
Then goes he to the length of all his arm,
There, my lord.
There falling out at tennis'; or perchance,
There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
That she should lock herself from his resort,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
That show of such an exercise may colour
That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
That your good beauties be the happy cause
That they do know my son, come you more nearer
That they may seem the taints of liberty,
That thus he suffers for.
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
That's not my meaning. But breathe his faults so quaintly
That, from her working, all his visage wann'd,
The better to beguile. This is for all:
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
The glowworm shows the matin to be near
The origin and commencement of his grief
The which he loved passing well.'
This something-settled matter in his heart,
That youth and observation copied there,
The Devil himself.
The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
The kettledrum and trumpet thus bray out
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
The triumph of his pledge.
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
The very faculties of eyes and ears.
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
There is a play to-night before the King.
They clip us drunkards and with swinish phrase
This heavy-headed revel east and west
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
This must not be.' And then I prescripts gave her,
This is the very ecstasy of love,
This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
This night to play before him.
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me;
Exit Ghost.
Exit Ghost.
Exit Ghost.
Exit Horatio.
Exit Messenger.
Exit [Polonius].
Exit.
Exit.
Farewell, dear mother.
Exit.
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth
Exit.
Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
For England.
Fie on't! ah, fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden
Folded the writ up in the form of th' other,
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
For by the image of my cause I see
For good Polonius' death, and we have done but greenly
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
For he himself is subject to his birth.
For he was likely, had he been put on,
For husband shalt thou-
For in the fatness of these pursy times
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.
For and a shrouding sheet;
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
Feeds on his wonder, keep, himself in clouds,
Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
Flourish. Exeunt all but Hamlet.
For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
Flourish. [Enter Claudius, King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet,
For art and exercise in your defence,
For her perfections. But my revenge will come.
For my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
For nature crescent does not grow alone
For such a guest is meet.
For such a guest is meet.
For that which thou hast done,- must send thee hence
For they are actions that a man might play;
Exit.
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Fare you well, my dove!
Follow my mother. King dies.
For food and diet, to some enterprise
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,
For if the King like not the comedy,
For it is as the air, invulnerable,
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
For what we know must be, and is as common
For women's fear and love holds quantity,
For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
For. Go softly on.
For. Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.
Fordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
Fort. Let four captains
Fort. Let us haste to hear it,

Fortinbras, Prince of Norway.
Forward, not permanent- sweet, not lasting;
Fran. Bernardo hath my place.
Fran. Bernardo?
Guil. Believe me, I cannot.
Ham. I do beseech you.
Fran. For this relief much thanks. 'Tis bitter cold,
Fran. Give you good night.
Fran. I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?
Guil. My lord, I cannot.
Fran. Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
Give us the foils. Come on.
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
Guil. O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
Ham. And do still, by these pickers and stealers!
Ham. Ay, sir, but 'while the grass grows'- the proverb is something
Ham. Good madam!
Fran. You come most carefully upon your hour.
Fran. Not a mouse stirring.
Friends both, go join you with some further aid.
Francisco, a soldier
From another one?
From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
From the first corse till he that died to-day,
Ghost. Do not forget. This visitation
Give him the cup.
God bless you, sir!
Guil. But these cannot I command to any utt'rance of harmony. I
Ham. Judgment!
Guil. I know, no touch of it, my lord.
Ham. And smelt so? Pah!
Ham. Come for the third, Laertes! You but dally.
Ham. I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.
Ham. I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
Ham. I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
Ham. I pray you.
Ham. It is as easy as lying. Govern these ventages with your
Guil. Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
Guil. Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
Guil. No, my lord; rather with choler.
Guil. The Queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit
Guil. What, my lord?
Ham. Come on, sir.
Ham. Sir, I cannot.
Ham. Dost thou think Alexander look'd o' this fashion i' th' earth?
Ham. I am tame, sir; pronounce.
Ham. Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseas'd. But, sir, such
Ham. Nay come! again! The Queen falls.
Ham. No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
Ham. O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no

Ham. Sir, I lack advancement.
Gent. She is importunate, indeed distract.
Gent. She speaks much of her father; says she hears
Gentlemen. (within) Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
Getrude, Queen of Denmark, mother to Hamlet.
Give it an understanding but no tongue.
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
Ham. Nay, I know not.
Ghost of Hamlet's Father.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice;
Give me my father!
Give me the cup. Let go! By heaven, I'll ha't.
Giving to you no further personal power
Guil. Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
Ham. Aha! Come, some music! Come, the recorders!
Guil. The King, sir-
Ham. I embrace it freely,
Ham. I'll be your foil, Laertes. In mine ignorance
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
Give you good night. Exit.
Give, me superfluous death. A noise within.
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Guil. Is in his retirement, marvellous distemper'd.
Ham. Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him,
Ham. Ay, sir, what of him?
Ham. No, by this bad.
Ham. Sir, a whole history.
Ham. That is Laertes,
Ham. This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
Ham. This?
Ham. To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
Ham. Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
Go to thy deathbed;
God 'a'mercy on his soul!
Goes slow and stately by them. Thrice he walk'd
Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.-
Good night- but go not to my uncle's bed.
Ham. A whole one I!
Good night, mother.
Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
Grop'd I to find out them; had my desire,
Guil. A thing, my lord?
Ham. 'Swounds, show me what thou't do.
Ham. 'Tis e'en so. The hand of little employment hath the daintier
Had he been vanquisher, as, by the same comart
Had made his course t' illume that part of heaven
Ham. 'The Mousetrap.' Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
Ham. An earnest conjuration from the King,
Ham. How came he mad?
Ham. As woman's love.
Ham. Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;
Ham. How long will a man lie i' th' earth ere he rot?
Ham. How strangely?
Ham. I lov'd Ophelia. Forty thousand brothers
Ham. I do not think so. Since he went into France I have been in
Ham. In happy time.
Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gaingiving as
Ham. Not a whit, we defy augury; there's a special providence in
Ham. O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
Ham. Thou pray'st not well.
Ham. She well instructs me.
Ham. Upon the talk of the poisoning?
Ham. Upon what ground?
Ham. Very well, my lord.
Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
Hor [aside to Hamlet] Is't not possible to understand in another
Ham. Being thus benetted round with villanies,
Ham. Ay, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you asham'd to
Ham. He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,
Ham. But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
Ham. Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon-
Ham. Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
Ham. He poisons him i' th' garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago.
Ham. Hear you, sir!
Ham. Here's the commission; read it at more leisure.
Ham. How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
Ham. How if I answer no?
Ham. How long is that since?
Ham. I am constant to my purposes; they follow the King's pleasure.
Ham. I beseech you remember.
Ham. I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
Ham. I humbly thank you, sir. [Aside to Horatio] Dost know this
Ham. I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
Ham. I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your

Ham. I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
Ham. Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
Ham. Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty,
Ham. Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
Ham. I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
Ham. It will be short; the interim is mine,
Ham. It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
Ham. Madam, how like you this play?
Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
Ham. Marry, this is miching malhecho; it means mischief.
Ham. No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
Ham. No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th'

Ham. Of him, sir.
Ham. Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!

Ham. They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
Ham. To this effect, sir, after what flourish your nature will.
Ham. What imports the nomination of this gentleman
Ham. What call you the carriages?
Ham. We shall know by this fellow. The players cannot keep counsel;
Ham. What man dost thou dig it for?
Ham. What woman then?
Ham. Up from my cabin,
Ham. Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for
Ham. What's his weapon?
Ham. What, frighted with false fire?
Ham. Why, e'en so! and now my Lady Worm's, chapless, and knock'd
Ham. What, the fair Ophelia?
Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
Ham. Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
Ham. Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
Ham. Whose was it?
Ham. Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
Ham. Why he more than another?
Ham. Why, man, they did make love to this employment!
Ham. Why?
Ham. With drink, sir?
Ham. You are welcome.
Ham. Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
Ham. [aside to Horatio] Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a
Ham. [aside] Wormwood, wormwood!
Hamlet comes back. What would you undertake
Hath clawed me in his clutch,
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
He should the bearers put to sudden death,
He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
Here's to thy health.
Here stooping to your clemency,
Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.
Hor. A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
Hor. 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
Hor. As thou art to thyself.
Hor. A piece of him.
Ham. Yours, yours. [Exit Osric.] He does well to commend it
Ham. [comes forward] What is he whose grief
Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
Hor. 'Tis here!
His silence will sit drooping.
Hor. Ay, good my lord.
Hor. Before my God, I might not this believe
Hor. Ay, my lord.
Hor. Custom hath made it in him a Property of easiness.
Hor. Do, if it will not stand.
Hor. Friends to this ground.
Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
Hamlet the Dane. [Leaps in after Laertes.
His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
Hor. Ay, my lord, And of calveskins too.
Hor. E'en so, my lord.
Hor. Good my lord, be quiet.
Hor. E'en so.
Hor. Half a share.
Hor. How was this seal'd?
Hor. I beseech you.
Hor. I did very well note him.
Hor. If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their
Hor. In what particular thought to work I know not;
Hor. Is't possible?
Hor. It might, my lord.
Hor. It must be shortly known to him from England
Hor. Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.
Hor. Nay, good my lord -
Hor. Not a jot more, my lord.
Hor. Peace! Who comes here?
Hor. Remember it, my lord!
Hor. So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
Hor. So have I heard and do in part believe it.
Hor. Stay! Speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
Hor. That can I.
Hor. That is most certain.
Guil. We will ourselves provide.
Guildenstern, courtier.
Had I but time (as this fell sergeant, Death,
Had witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
Ham. 'By-and-by' is easily said.- Leave me, friends.
Ham. (within) Mother, mother, mother!
Ham. And fix'd his eyes upon you?
Ham. 'Tis very strange.
Ham. A bloody deed- almost as bad, good mother,
Ham. A king of shreds and patches!-
Ham. As th'art a man,
Ham. A murtherer and a villain!
Ham. Arm'd, say you?
Ham. But where was this?
Ham. A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
Ham. At supper.
Ham. Ay, lady, it was my word.
Ham. Come, come, and sit you down. You shall not budge I
Ham. Ay, madam, it is common.
Ham. Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
Ham. But soft! What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
Ham. Did you not speak to it?
Ham. Do not believe it.
Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
Ham. Do you see nothing there?
Ham. Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Ham. Ecstasy?
Ham. For God's love let me hear!
Ham. From top to toe?
Ham. For England?
Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
Ham. How does the Queen?
Ham. I will watch to-night.
Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
Ham. Methinks it is like a weasel.
Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
Ham. Mother, you have my father much offended.
Ham. Now, mother, what's the matter?
He hath not fail'd to pester us with message
Ham. O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd.
Ham. Or like a whale.
Ham. Then will I come to my mother by-and-by.- They fool me to the
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
His further gait herein, in that the levies,
Ham. Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
Hath turn'd itself on me. Lo, here I lie,
Ham. Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.
Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,
He took my father grossly, full of bread,
Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
Here was a gentleman of Normandy.
His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood;
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
Hor. (reads the letter) 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlook'd
Hor. I warr'nt it will.
Hor. Let him bless thee too.
Hor. Let them come in.
Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
Hor. This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
Hor. Very well, my lord.
Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
Hor. What are they that would speak with me?
Hor. What art thou that usurp'st this time of night
Hor. [aside to Hamlet] I knew you must be edified by the margent
Hor. [aside] His purse is empty already. All's golden words are
How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my Lord Such-a-one, that
How in my words somever she be shent,
How now, sweet queen?
How much I had to do to calm his rage I
Hor. Well, sit we down,
Hor. Why, what a king is this!
Hor. You might have rhym'd.
Hor. You will lose this wager, my lord.
Hor. [aside to Hamlet] No, my good lord.
How now? What news?
How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
I am afeard You make a wanton of me.
I do not know from what part of the world
I doubt some foul play. Would the night were come!
I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
I bought an unction of a mountebank,
I be so able as now.
I can no more. The King, the King's to blame.
I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze
I have seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
I could not but by her. The other motive
I do receive your offer'd love like love,
I ha't!
I had my father's signet in my purse,
I have a voice and precedent of peace
I lov'd your father, and we love ourself,
I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that the toe
I lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.
I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
I once did hold it, as our statists do,
I pray you go with me.
I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well.
If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
I stay too long. But here my father comes.
I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed
If Hamlet from himself be taken away,
I'll visit you.
I will speak daggers to her, but use none.
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
In neither aught, or in extremity.
In his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd,
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
I'll cross it, though it blast me.- Stay illusion!
Importing the surrender of those lands
In thee there is not half an hour of life.
It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
I'll rant as well as thou.
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
In further evil?
In the corrupted currents of this world
In which the majesty of buried Denmark
Into a tow'ring passion.
Is not this something more than fantasy?
Is the great love the general gender bear him,
Is the main motive of our preparations,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
If there be any good thing to be done,
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
Importing health and graveness. Two months since
If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
If with too credent ear you list his songs,
If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see.
If she unmask her beauty to the moon.
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,
In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
In youth when I did love, did love,
It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
If one could match you. The scrimers of their nation
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
It may be death.
King. I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.
In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
King. Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
It warms the very sickness in my heart
King. 'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'
King. 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.
King. Break not your sleeps for that. You must not think
King. Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
King. A Norman.
King. A very riband in the cap of youth-
King. Arm you, I pray you, to th', speedy voyage;
King. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
King. Gertrude, do not drink.
King. Give me some light! Away!
King. He made confession of you;
King. I do not think't.
King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
King. It falls right.
King. If it be so, Laertes
King. Laertes, was your father dear to you?
King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
King. Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
King. Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
King. I do believe you think what now you speak;
King. I do not fear it, I have seen you both;
King. Laertes, you shall hear them.
King. Let's follow, Gertrude.
King. Let's further think of this,
King. No place indeed should murther sanctuarize;
King. Not that I think you did not love your father;
King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
King. O, for two special reasons,
King. O, he is mad, Laertes.
King. Our son shall win.
King. Part them! They are incens'd.
Queen. There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
Ham. Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Ham. Good.
Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all.
Ham. Here, thou incestuous, murd'rous, damned Dane,
Ham. His beard was grizzled- no?
Ham. I must to England; you know that?
Ham. I would I had been there.
Ham. Good sir, whose powers are these?
Ham. Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
Ham. How is it with you, lady?
Ham. How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
Ham. I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
Ham. Indeed, indeed, sirs. But this troubles me.
Ham. Nor did you nothing hear?
Ham. He will stay till you come.
Ham. I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
Ham. I am glad to see you well.
Ham. I am very glad to see you.- [To Bernardo] Good even, sir.-
Ham. I see a cherub that sees them. But come, for England!
Ham. I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
Ham. I prithee do not mock me, fellow student.
Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so,
Ham. Look here upon th's picture, and on this,
Ham. In my mind's eye, Horatio.
Ham. Not so, my lord. I am too much i' th' sun.
Ham. In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not
Ham. My mother! Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
Ham. Nay, I know not. Is it the King?
Ham. O, I die, Horatio!
Ham. Safely stow'd.
Ham. Sir, my good friend- I'll change that name with you.
Ham. Saw? who?
Ham. Seems, madam, Nay, it is. I know not 'seems.'
Ham. That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
Ham. Nay, but to live
Ham. No, by the rood, not so!
Ham. Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain
Ham. Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
Ham. Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
Ham. O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body.
Ham. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
High on a stage be placed to the view;
Ham. O, throw away the worser part of it,
Ham. On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
Ham. Pale or red?
Ham. Such an act
Ham. Then saw you not his face?
Ham. Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
Ham. The King my father?
Ham. The point envenom'd too?
Ham. There's letters seal'd; and my two schoolfellows,
Ham. Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Ham. What's the matter now?
Ham. What, look'd he frowningly.
Ham. Who commands them, sir?
Ham. Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
Ham. [aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
Ham. Why, look you there! Look how it steals away!
Ham. [draws] How now? a rat? Dead for a ducat, dead!
Hamlet, son to the former, and nephew to the present king.
He answers:
He is dead and gone;
He is gone, he is gone,
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
He never gave commandment for their death.
He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
He never will come again.
Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
Hold you the watch to-night?
Hor. As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
Hor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,
Help, help, ho!
Here is your husband, like a mildew'd ear
Here's yet some liquor left.
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Her brother is in secret come from France;
His beard was as white as snow,
Hor. Never believe it.
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
His liberty is full of threats to all-
His means of death, his obscure funeral-
Hor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
Hor. Hail to your lordship!
Hor. My lord, I did;
Hor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.
Hor. Not from his mouth,
Hor. I saw him once. He was a goodly king.
Hoist with his own petar; and 't shall go hard
Hor. Nay, very pale.
Hor. It would have much amaz'd you.
Hor. My lord, the King your father.
Hor. Most constantly.
Hor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Hor. Not when I saw't.
Hor. Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,
Hor. O, where, my lord?
Hor. O, yes, my lord! He wore his beaver up.
Hor. Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
Hor. Season your admiration for a while
King. Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard.
Her mood will needs be pitied.
Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen
Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
Hor. 'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
Hor. What is it you will see?
Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Horatio, friend to Hamlet.
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
I must be cruel, only to be kind;
Horatio!- or I do forget myself.
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit.
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
Laer. Alas, then she is drown'd?
I cannot live to hear the news from England,
I do beseech you give him leave to go.
I had forgot! 'Tis so concluded on.
I shall not look upon his like again.
I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
I'll blessing beg of you.- For this same lord,
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.-
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
In going back to school in Wittenberg,
In hugger-mugger to inter him; Poor Ophelia
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
Into the chapel. I pray you haste in this.
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
It had been so with us, had we been there.
King. There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
King. How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
King. O heavy deed!
King. To thine own peace. If he be now return'd
King. What is the cause, Laertes,
King. Thanks, dear my lord.
King. The doors are broke.
King. What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
Laer. Come, one for me.
It will be laid to us, whose providence
King. Dead.
King. Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
King. How long hath she been thus?
King. She sounds to see them bleed.
King. O Gertrude, come away!
King. Pretty Ophelia!
King. The very same.
King. Take thy fair hour, Laertes. Time be thine,
King. Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
King. Thy loving father, Hamlet.
Laer. Ay my lord,
King. Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
Laer. A Norman was't?
Laer. I thank you. Keep the door. [Exeunt his Followers.]
Hor. What's that, my lord?
Hor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He
How all occasions do inform against me
How now O What hath befall'n?
How should I your true-love know
If his chief good and market of his time
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
If you desire to know the certainty
In dreadful secrecy impart they did,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
How these things came about. So shall You hear
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.
I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
In the dead vast and middle of the night
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
It is most retrograde to our desire;
I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
Is strict in his arrest) O, I could tell you-
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
Is not to stir without great argument,
Is very cunning in.
It could not move thus.
It is a poison temper'd by himself.
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
King. Good Laertes,
It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
King. Who shall stay you?
King. Will you know them then?
It lifted up it head and did address
It sends some precious instance of itself
It shall as level to your judgment pierce
King. 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
King. Conceit upon her father.
King. Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
King. I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
King. Why, now You speak
Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
Laer. How now? What noise is that?
Laer. It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain;
Laer. My dread lord,
Laer. My lord, I'll hit him now.
Laer. My will, not all the world!
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
King. Let him demand his fill.
King. [aside] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
Laer. And so have I a noble father lost;
Laer. Do you see this, O God?
Laer. Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
Laer. I pray you give me leave.
Laer. Have at you now!
Laer. He is justly serv'd.
Laer. How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
Laer. I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come!
Laer. I am satisfied in nature,
Laer. It well appears. But tell me
Laer. I know him well. He is the broach indeed
Laer. My necessaries are embark'd. Farewell.
Laer. None but his enemies.
Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
Laer. Know you the hand?
Laer. Lay her i' th' earth;
Laer. My lord, I will be rul'd;
Laer. O, fear me not!
Laer. Say you so? Come on. Play.
Laer. O, treble woe
Laer. That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
Laer. This is too heavy; let me see another.
Laer. Think it no more.
Laer. This nothing's more than matter.
Laer. Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
I pray thee stay with us, go not to Wittenberg.
If by direct or by collateral hand
If it be made of penetrable stuff;
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
If damned custom have not braz'd it so
In filial obligation for some term
I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;
I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune.
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
In noise so rude against me?
It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
King. How do you, pretty lady?
In obstinate condolement is a course
Is thought-sick at the act.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
King. Alas, alas!
King. Pluck thein asunder.
King. At supper? Where?
King. Ay, Hamlet.
King. Bring him before us.
King. But where is he?
King. Go seek him there. [To Attendants.]
King. Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
King. So you shall;
King. We doubt it nothing. Heartily farewell.
Laer. A document in madness! Thoughts and remembrance fitted.
Laer. Must there no more be done?
King. Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.
King. Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,-
King. Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
King. Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
King. What dost thou mean by this?
King. Where is Polonius?
Laer. A touch, a touch; I do confess't.
Laer. Drown'd! O, where?
Let Hercules himself do what he may,
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
Mar. It is offended.
Mar. Is it not like the King?
Mar. Question it, Horatio.
King. O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
King. What do you call the play?
King. [rises] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.
Laer. Come, my lord. They play.
Laer. Let this be so.
Laer. No.
Leave wringing of your hinds. Peace! sit you down
Mar. 'Tis gone and will not answer.
Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
King. Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.
Laer. I will do't!
Laer. The devil take thy soul!
Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here.
No noble rite nor formal ostentation,-
No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
No, no, he is dead;
No, not to stay the finding of the axe,
Queen. Ay me, what act,
Laer. To cut his throat i' th' church!
Laer. To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms
Laer. What part is that, my lord?
Laertes before you fall to play.
Last, and as such containing as all these,
Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
Leaps in the grave.
Leave us.
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Lest with this piteous action you convert
Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
Laer. Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric.
Laer. Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
Laer. Upon my life, Lamound.
Laer. Where is my father?
Laer. Where is this king?- Sirs, staid you all without.
Laer. You mock me, sir.
Laertes, son to Polonius.
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.
Let me not think on't! Frailty, thy name is woman!-
Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,
Laer. Well, again!
Laer. What ceremony else?
Laer. What ceremony else?
Laer. What out of this, my lord?
Like Niobe, all tears- why she, even she
Laer. Why ask you this?
Laer. [aside] And yet it is almost against my conscience.
Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,
Larded all with sweet flowers;
Let in the maid, that out a maid
Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed;
Let us impart what we have seen to-night
Like to a murd'ring piece, in many places
Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
Like a good child and a true gentleman.
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,-
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Look where he goes even now out at the portal!
Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
Lord. My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who
Looking before and after, gave us not
Lord. The King and Queen and all are coming down.
Lord. The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
Lords Attendant.
Lords, ladies, Officers, Soldiers, Sailors, Messengers, Attendants.
Luc. Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Lost by his father, with all bands of law,
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
Makes mouths at the invisible event,
Mar. 'Tis gone!
Mar. And liegemen to the Dane.
Mar. Good now, sit down, and tell me he that knows,
Mar. Holla, Bernardo!
Mar. Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
Mar. It faded on the crowing of the cock.
Mar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
Mar. O, farewell, honest soldier.
Mar. Peace! break thee off! Look where it comes again!
Mar. My good lord!
Mar. Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
Mar. Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
Mar. Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
Mess. Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
Mess. Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.
Mar. What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
Marcellus, officer.
May fit us to our shape. If this should fall,
May give his saying deed; which is no further
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
Marcellus?
Marcellus, Officer.
Most holy and religious fear it is
May one be pardon'd and retain th' offence?
May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
Mess. Save Yourself, my lord:
Methought it was very sweet;
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
Most throughly for my father.
My father- methinks I see my father.
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Mother, good night.- Indeed, this counsellor
My father's spirit- in arms? All is not well.
My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain.
Meet what I would have well, and it destroy,
More than in words?
Most generous, and free from all contriving,
My head should be struck off.
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
My brother shall know of it; and so I thank you for your good
My father's brother, but no more like my father
My operant powers their functions leave to do.
My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites-
No more to undertake it, I will work him
My soul is full of discord and dismay.
My stern effects. Then what I have to do
Next, Your son gone, and he most violent author
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
No medicine in the world can do thee good.
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
My virtue or my plague, be it either which,-
Near Elsinore.
Never departed more.
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! Exit.
No more, sweet Hamlet!
Never to rise again. Thy mother's poison'd.
No more.
Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
No.
None wed the second but who killed the first.
Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
Nor thine on me! Dies.
Not shriving time allow'd.
O, methought there- a- was nothing- a- meet.
O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
Of entrance to a quarrel; but being in,
Of my true mother.
One word more, good lady.
Nor shall you do my ear that violence
Nor the dejected havior of the visage,
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
Now fear I this will give it start again;
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
O good Horatio, what a wounded name
Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead
Now what my love is, proof hath made you know;
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
O thou vile king,
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting.
Now, out of this-
O heat, dry up my brains! Tears seven times salt
O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
O, a Pit of clay for to be made
O, ho!
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
O'erbears Your offices. The rabble call him lord;
O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
O, say!
O, you must wear your rue with a difference! There's a daisy. I
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
Of bell and burial.
Of mine own eyes.
O, speak!
O, step between her and her fighting soul
Of blue Olympus.
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,
Of mighty opposites.
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
O, the recorders! Let me see one. To withdraw with you- why do
O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
Of these dilated articles allow. [Gives a paper.]
Of thinking too precisely on th' event,-
Of those effects for which I did the murther-
Of your dear father's death, is't writ in Your revenge
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.
On plots and errors happen.
Oph. 'Tis brief, my lord.

Oph. No more but so?
Oph. Do you doubt that?
Oph. I hope all will be well. We must be patient; but I cannot
Of him that brought them.
Of his own just remove; the people muddied,
Of impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief;
Of the unworthiest siege.
Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
On Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.

Oph. Pray you mark.
Oph. Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
Oph. Still better, and worse.
Oph. I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
Oph. Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't!
Oph. Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask, you what
Oph. Say you? Nay, pray You mark.
Oph. You must sing 'A-down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O,
Oph. There's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you,
Oph. There's rosemary, that's for remembrance. Pray you, love,
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
Oph. Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
Oph. What means this, my lord?
Oph. Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?
Oph. You are naught, you are naught! I'll mark the play.
Oph. You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
Ophelia, daughter to Polonius.
Or not at all.
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
Osr. Of Laertes?
Oph. Will he tell us what this show meant?
Oph. You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
Osr. Ay, my good lord.
Osr. It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
Osr. Sir?
Osr. The King, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
Osr. Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

Osr. How is't, Laertes?
Osric, courtier.
Other. Go to!
Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
Osr. The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
Other. But is this law?
Other. Nay, but hear you, Goodman Delver!
Other. Was he a gentleman?
Other. Why, 'tis found so.
Other. Why, he had none.
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
Other. Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a
Osr. I know you are not ignorant-
Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed;
Or for some frontier?
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
Or like a creature native and indued
Osr. Look to the Queen there, ho!
Osr. The King, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses;
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit.
Osr. I commend my duty to your lordship.
Osr. Nothing neither way.
Osr. Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere- I cannot
Osr. You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-
Osr. Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
Other. I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight.
Other. The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand

Our indiscretion sometime serves us well
Our purpose may hold there.- But stay, what noise,
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
Osr. Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart
Osr. I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
Osr. I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him
Osr. I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
Osr. Shall I redeliver you e'en so?
Osr. Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is
Osr. Rapier and dagger.
Out of his subject; and we here dispatch
Osr. Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
Other. Marry, now I can tell!
Other. Mass, I cannot tell.
Our sovereign process, which imports at full,
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
Perchance 'twill walk again.

Pol. My lord, he's going to his mother's closet.
Pol. He will come straight. Look you lay home to him.
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
Over the nasty sty!
Out of his lunacies.
Out of the shot and danger of desire.
Passing through nature to eternity.
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
Pol. [behind] O, I am slain!
Pol. Give o'er the play.
Players.
Pol. By th' mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
Pol. He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
Pol. My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.
Pol. I will say so. Exit.
Pol. It is back'd like a weasel.
Pol. Very like a whale.
Pol. Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame!
Pol. [behind] What, ho! help, help, help!
Popp'd in between th' election and my hopes;
Polonius, Laertes and his sister Ophelia, [Voltemand, Cornelius,]
Polonius, Lord Chamberlain.
Polonius.
Pours the poison in his ears.
Pray you be round with him.
Prepare to play.
Priest. Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
Priest. No more be done.
Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Pursued my life.
Queen. Alack,
Queen. Alas, look here, my lord!
Queen. But not by him!
Pro. For us, and for our tragedy,
Queen. Alas, how is't with you,
Queen. Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
Queen. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
Queen. Calmly, good Laertes.
Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
Queen. Drown'd, drown'd.
Queen, Laertes, with Lords attendant.]
Queen. Alack, what noise is this?
Queen. Alas, he's mad!
Queen. As kill a king?
Queen. Bestow this place on us a little while.
Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
Queen. Come, let me wipe thy face.
Queen. For love of God, forbear him!
Queen. Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
Queen. Hamlet, Hamlet!
Queen. Have you forgot me?
Queen. He's fat, and scant of breath.
Queen. How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
Queen. How fares my lord?
Queen. If it be,
Queen. I'll warrant you; fear me not. Withdraw; I hear him coming.
Queen. O my son, what theme?
Queen. How now, Ophelia?
Queen. I will not speak with her.
Queen. I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me. Drinks.
Queen. Let her come in.
Queen. Nay, then I'll set those to you that can speak.
Queen. O Hamlet, speak no more!
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Queen. Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.
Queen. Mad as the sea and wind when both contend
Queen. No more!
Queen. Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,
Queen. Nay, but Ophelia-
Queen. No, no! the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!
Queen. O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
Queen. O me, what hast thou done?
Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
Queen. Sleep rock thy brain,
Queen. This is mere madness;
Queen. So many journeys may the sun and moon
Queen. To whom do you speak this?
Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away.
Queen. No, nothing but ourselves.
Queen. Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
Queen. O, confound the rest!
Queen. The lady doth protest too much, methinks.
Queen. O, speak to me no more!
Queen. Sweets to the sweet! Farewell.
Queen. To draw apart the body he hath kill'd;
Queen. What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
Queen. The instances that second marriage move
Queen. One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
Queen. What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murther me?
Queen. What would she have?
Queen. What shall I do?
Ros. Will't please you go, my lord?
Scene IV.
Scene V.
Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet?
Requite him for your father.
Quoth she, 'Before you tumbled me,
Repast them with my blood.
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
Reynaldo, servant to Polonius.
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
Richer than that which four successive kings
Ros. Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.
Rough-hew them how we will-
Ros. Believe what?
Ros. Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely
Ros. How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself
Ros. I understand you not, my lord.
Ros. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
Ros. My lord, you once did love me.
Ros. She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
Ros. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
Ros. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
Ros. The single and peculiar life is bound
Ros. Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
Ros. What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
Ros. Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
Rosencrantz, courtier.
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
Sailor. God bless you, sir.
Sailor. 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
Should patch a wall t' expel the winter's flaw!
Servant. Seafaring men, sir. They say they have letters for you.
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
So nightly toils the subject of the land,
Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?
So excellent a king, that was to this
T' o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
THE END
Tell him that by his license Fortinbras
That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Than that which dearest father bears his son
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
That for a fantasy and trick of fame
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
That treason can but peep to what it would,
That I essentially am not in madness,
That hath in it no profit but the name.
That have a father klll'd, a mother stain'd,
That thy rebellion looks so giantlike?
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
See what a grace was seated on this brow;
SCENE.- Elsinore.
Ros. Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
Scene III.
Scene II.
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
Scene IV.
Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.
So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
So full of artless jealousy is guilt
Speak to her, Hamlet.
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
Speak, man.
Such was the very armour he had on
That roars so loud and thunders in the index?
THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK
Th' associates tend, and everything is bent
That else leans on th' affair. Pray you make haste.
Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
The bark is ready and the wind at help,
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
That to the use of actions fair and good
Scene VI.
Seek for thy noble father in the dust.
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
She turns to favour and to prettiness.
Sir, in this audience,
Speak loudly for him.
Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.
She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
Than I to Hercules. Within a month,
That both the world, I give to negligence,
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble,
The soldiers' music and the rites of war
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
The imminent death of twenty thousand men
This grave shall have a living monument.
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.
This sudden sending him away must seem
There's tricks i' th' world, and hems, and beats her heart;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
This was your husband. Look you now what follows.
This unprevailing woe, and think of us
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
The Queen, the courtiers. Who is this they follow?
Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Than Young Laertes, in a riotous head,
Stick fiery off indeed.
Th' important acting of your dread command?
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
That I must call't in question.
That I have utt'red. Bring me to the test,
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
The head is not more native to the heart,
That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
That I am guiltless of your father's death,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
These hands are not more like.
These words like daggers enter in mine ears.
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
That might your nature, honour, and exception
That not your trespass but my madness speaks.
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
That swoopstake you will draw both friend and foe,
The corse they follow did with desp'rate hand
Then up he rose and donn'd his clo'es
The King is a thing-
They bore him barefac'd on the bier
Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England
To be your Valentine.
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,
Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
Till the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,
To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack,
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.
Till of this flat a mountain you have made
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
To business with the King, more than the scope
To cast thee up again. What may this mean
To do obsequious sorrow. But to persever
The King shall drink to Hamlet's better breath,
The Queen's closet.
The apparition comes. I knew your father.
The death I gave him. So again, good night.
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
The lists, and full proportions are all made
The ratifiers and props of every word,
The unseen good old man.
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
The ocean, overpeering of his list,
There's such divinity doth hedge a king
They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
They shall go far with little.
This bodiless creation ecstasy
This mad young man. But so much was our love
This man shall set me packing.
This marvel to you.
Thou know'st 'tis common. All that lives must die,
Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.
Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
Till by some elder masters of known honour
Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil
To show us so much gentry and good will
To be commanded.
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
To show my duty in your coronation,
To lay our service freely at your feet,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
To punish me with this, and this with me,
To tell the secrets of my prison house,
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
To the next abstinence; the next more easy;
To try conclusions, in the basket creep
To what I shall unfold.
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
To give it due content.
To give the world assurance of a man.
To give these mourning duties to your father;
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
To reason most absurd, whose common theme
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
To outface me with leaping in her grave?
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
To put an antic disposition on),
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax
To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.
To let you know of it.
To make it truster of your own report
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once.
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
To sing a requiem and such rest to her
To speak of horrors- he comes before me.
To tell us this.
To those of mine!
To you alone.
To you in satisfaction; but if not,
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
Transports his poisoned shot- may miss our name
Tweaks me by th' nose? gives me the lie i' th' throat
Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd,
Unmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
We cannot get from him.
Upon whose property and most dear life
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
Volt. Most fair return of greetings and desires.
Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet.
We must with all our majesty and skill
Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent.
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
We should profane the service of the dead
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg-
We'll put the matter to the present push.-
Upon the beat and flame of thy distemper
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
Welcome, my good friends.
We go to gain a little patch of ground
We would not understand what was most fit,
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Well ratified by law and heraldry,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
What company, at what expense; and finding
What does this mean, my lord?
Where every god did seem to set his seal

Scene VII.
Scene III.
Scene III.
Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
So bloodily hast struck.
Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
So fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
Should have a back or second, that might hold
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven,
So far from cheer and from your former state.
So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
So tell him, with th' occurrents, more and less,
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
Speak of it! Stay, and speak!- Stop it, Marcellus!
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
Sport and repose lock from me day and night,
Such love must needs be treason in my breast.
Speak to me.
Some say that ever, 'gainst that season comes
Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies
Subscrib'd it, gave't th' impression, plac'd it safely,
Speak to me.
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
That are so fortified against our story,
That capability and godlike reason
She's so conjunctive to my life and soul
So by his father lost; and this, I take it,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
So crimeful and so capital in nature,
Spreads his arms.
Th' effect of what I wrote?
Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
That has no relish of salvation in't-
That he could nothing do but wish and beg
That he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed
That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th' ulcer!
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
Stood challenger on mount of all the age
Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
That I might be the organ.
That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
That our devices still are overthrown;
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream.
That live and feed upon your Majesty.
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,
That he which hath your noble father slain
That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests
That thou so many princes at a shot
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
That are but mutes or audience to this act,
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
That we with wisest sorrow think on him
That would not let me sleep. Methought I lay
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
The bell then beating one-
The ears are senseless that should give us bearing
The light and careless livery that it wears
The drink, the drink! I am poison'd. [Dies.]
The inward service of the mind and soul
The source of this our watch, and the chief head
The lives of many. The cesse of majesty
The memory be green, and that it us befitted
The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
The rather, if you could devise it so
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom.
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
Thin settled age his sables and his weeds,
The safety and health of this whole state,
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege.
The terms of our estate may not endure
The virtue of his will; but you must fear,
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio
There is no shuffling; there the action lies
There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
They had begun the play. I sat me down;
They were given me by Claudio; he receiv'd them
This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.
That to Laertes I forgot myself,
That was and is the question of these wars.
That, if again this apparition come,
The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth,
The changeling never known. Now, the next day
The Scripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll
The canker galls the infants of the spring
The chariest maid is prodigal enough
The cock crows.
The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
The crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian burial.
The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
The portraiture of his. I'll court his favours.
The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit.
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
The tedious day with sleep.
The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord.
Therefore I have entreated him along,
Therefore let's follow.
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
This presence knows,
This warlike volley.
Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
Throws up [another skull].
The hart ungalled play;
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,
The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian. You
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
There lives within the very flame of love
The violence of either grief or joy
Then, venom, to thy work. Hurts the King.
This above all- to thine own self be true,
This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
This present object made probation.
Thou canst not then be false to any man.
This is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
Their own enactures with themselves destroy.
This is th' imposthume of much wealth and peace,
This realm dismantled was
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Thou know'st already.

There with fantastic garlands did she come

This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
Thus much the business is: we have here writ
Thus runs the world away.

Though inclination be as sharp as will.

Thrown out his angle for my Proper life,
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.

Till then in patience our proceeding be.
Till then sit still, my soul. Foul deeds will rise,

To any pastime?
To be contracted in one brow of woe,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
To exploit now ripe in my device,
To contract- O- the time for- a- my behove,
To desperation turn my trust and hope,
To give in evidence. What then? What rests?
To both your honours.
To give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit.
To give th' assay of arms against your Majesty.

To his unmast'red importunity.

To keep those many many bodies safe
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
To mine own room again; making so bold
To muddy death.

To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.
To quit him with this arm? And is't not to be damn'd
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
To let this canker of our nature come
To show his grief. Let her be round with him;
To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub!
To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
To their lord's murther. Roasted in wrath and fire,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
We heard it all.- My lord, do as you please;
To youth and liberty.

We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings-
We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him,
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
What is the matter?
What is the reason that you use me thus?
What majesty should be, what duty is,
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
What think you on't?
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
What we two nights have seen.
What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
What's near it with it. It is a massy wheel,
What, have you given him any hard words of late?
What, is Horatio there ?
When I had seen this hot love on the wing
When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
When down her weedy trophies and herself
When he himself might his quietus make
When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.

What I have said to you.

What might you think? No, I went round to work
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
When I to sulph'rous and tormenting flames
When he th' ambitious Norway combated.
When in your motion you are hot and dry-
When he is fit and seasoned for his passage?
When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us
When second husband kisses me in bed.
Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
When it prov'd otherwise.?
When second husband let me be accurst!
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
When sorrows come, they come not single spies.
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
When thou liest howling.
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
When we would bring him on to some confession
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Where is your son?
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where should We have our thanks?
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
Where we shall find him most conveniently. Exeunt.
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King. Exit.
Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
Wherein they say you shine, Your sun of parts
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly,
Which happily foreknowing may avoid,
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
Which bewept to the grave did not go
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,
Which have solicited- the rest is silence. Dies.
Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,
Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
Which, as her winks and nods and gestures yield them,
Which we do tender as we dearly grieve
Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
Why does the drum come hither?
Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
Will return'd shall know you are come home.
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus
Which may to you, perhaps, seein much unsinew'd,
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
Which was declining on the milky head
Who in her duty and obedience, mark,
Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do,'
Which I have told thee, of my father's death.
Which is not tomb enough and continent
Which is the mightier. In his lawless fit
Which let thy wisdom fear. Hold off thy hand!
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
Why the man dies.- I humbly thank you, sir.
Will be some danger; which for to prevent,
Will not debate the question of this straw.
Will you do this? Keep close within your chamber.
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother!
Which now goes too free-footed.
Whiles rank corruption, mining all within,
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
With an attent ear, till I may deliver
Whose motive in this case should stir me most
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
Why thou art thus incens'd. Let him go, Gertrude.
Will You walk out of the air, my lord?
Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,
Will you be rul'd by me?
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
Will bring him to his wonted way again,
With an entreaty, herein further shown,
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
With all my love I do commend me to you;
With all the strength and armour of the mind
With an auspicious, and a dropping eye,
With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot
With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
With the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought
Would have reverted to my bow again,
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
With us to watch the minutes of this night,
With sore distraction. What I have done
With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
With windlasses and with assays of bias,
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
With variable objects, shall expel
With, hoo! such bugs and goblins in my life-
Within the centre.
Witness this army of such mass and charge,
With which she followed my poor father's body
Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears
Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
Why should we in our peevish opposition
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge!
With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
With all my imperfections on my head.
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
With arms encumb'red thus, or this head-shake,
With true-love showers.
Who does it, then? His madness. If't be so,
Who hath reliev'd you?
Who is't that can inform me?
Whose violent property fordoes itself
Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
With most miraculous organ, I'll have these Players
Why seems it so particular with thee?
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
Why this same strict and most observant watch
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
Will sate itself in a celestial bed
With fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself.
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven
Would have mourn'd longer) married with my uncle;
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
Why to a public count I might not go
Why you proceeded not against these feats
Will nothing stick Our person to arraign
Will want true colour- tears perchance for blood.
Yet must not we put the strong law on him.

With pestilent speeches of his father's death,
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
With this slave's offal. Bloody bawdy villain!

Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
Yet needfull too; for youth no less becomes
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
You are the most immediate to our throne,
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night;
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
With this regard their currents turn awry
Without the which we are Pictures or mere beasts;
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they distill'd
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts-
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Would make them capable.- Do not look upon me,
Would step from this to this? Sense sure you have,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
Yet I,
Yet now I must confess, that duty done,
You cannot call it love; for at your age
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
